## ✨ Overview

**Dompet Sehat** is an interactive, choice-based web game designed as a financial literacy simulation. 🧠 Players step into the shoes of a young Indonesian adult trying to manage their monthly salary for 28 days. The game tackles familiar local challenges like balancing needs vs. wants, dealing with sudden expenses, and navigating the temptations of a consumptive lifestyle. Can you make it to the next payday with your finances, happiness, and health intact? Your final balance determines your fate!

## 🎲 How To Play
